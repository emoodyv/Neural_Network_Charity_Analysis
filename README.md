# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this progect was to utilize neural networks to accurately predict results.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

The variable in the DataFrame that is the target is 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'.
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

The variables taht were considered the features were the affiliation and classification types.
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

The special consideration columns could be removed.
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

I selected a total of 60 neurons across 3 layers with 2 activation functions for my network.
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

I was only able to get to 69% accuracy.
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

I attempted to increase/decrease the neurons and layers and change the activation functions.

## Summary
Overall I was only able to increase the accuracy of the model to 69%. This model could possible be impoved by adding neurons.
